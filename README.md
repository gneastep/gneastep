# hello-world
# This repository is about me (Gunnar) and my goals for learning to write code.

I'm a PhD student working in Jerry Wang's lab in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics at UAB. So far, I've completed work on an interesting type IV pilin protein made by the extremophlic archaea Sulfolobales islandicus that can assemble into two different types of filaments called pili. My current work is focusing on bacterial flagella and cytochrome nanowires. 

Our lab uses cryo-EM to determine the molecular structures of flagella, pili, and other interesting machines used by bacteria and archaea to sense, navigate, and compete in their microscopic worlds. These appendages are super important to the survival of microbes, and they also look pretty cool. Under the electron microscope, pili look like little hairs branching off of the surface of microbes. 

With cryo-EM, a technique based on collecting images of a biological specimen with an electron microscope at cryogenic temperatures, we can easily tell that these hairs are in fact long filaments made by pilin proteins assembled in a spiraling pattern! In fact, we can determine the structure of the individual proteins in the pili with near-atomic precision, showing us exactly how they pack together and allowing us to hypothesize how pili (and other filaments) might carry out their important tasks.


I'm on GitHub to learn to write better code and manage it well! I'll be casually writing simple scripts to help me learn the principals behind cryo-EM and also coding analysis tools if I need something specific that doesn't exist to answer a question in my research. With a bit of practice, time, and luck, I am hoping to reach the point where I can collaborate with others to make tools for analysing cryo-EM datasets exported from third-party tools like CryoSPARC and RELION.

See you around!
